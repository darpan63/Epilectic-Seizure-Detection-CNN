## About

This project develops a deep learning approach to epileptic seizure detection using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, further enhanced with LSTM layers to capture temporal patterns in the data. The system is designed to accurately differentiate between seizure and non-seizure events, providing a robust tool for clinical decision support and early intervention. Data visualization using Matplotlib complements the model by offering clear insights into critical metrics and performance trends.

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset comprising EEG or similar bio-signals labeled for seizure events. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize features, and segment the signals appropriately for input into the deep learning model.

- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  - Data cleaning and normalization using Pandas and NumPy.
  - Segmentation and reshaping of time-series data for CNN-LSTM model input.
